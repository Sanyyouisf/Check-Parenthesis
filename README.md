##Check-Parenthesis

- Implement the functions for each of the 3 buttons and display the metrics on the screen each time the corresponding button is clicked, fix any bugs along the way

`Input an equation`

- The parenthesis are balanced:   `Check balance`
- The deepest level is:           `Get depth`
- The answer is:                  `Display levels`

- `Extra credit` : Uncomment the following line and implement logic that hides the other three buttons and causes the metrics to automatically update as the user types
- `Extra credit` : The getAnswer function should only work for basic math equations
